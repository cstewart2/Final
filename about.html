<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><span class="havoc"><em><a href="index.html">Havoc Comics</a></em></span> is a Missouri based online comic book store founded and created by Christopher Stewart in 2017. <span class="havoc"><em><a href="index.html">Havoc Comics</a></em></span> was envisioned as place where anyone can have access to the new comics they want, no matter where they live. This ideology was brought on by the experience of our founder's youth. His experience as child was that he did not have a local comic book store and never had access to comics in general; this caused him to miss out on years of what is now his passion. Like our founder many people, in towns or smaller cities, may miss out on years of stories they may be passionate about. That is why our goal as a company is to make comic books as easily accessible to people in rural areas as they are to thoughs in urban areas.</p>
